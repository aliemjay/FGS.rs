# FragGeneScan in Rust

The assignment for Computational Biology was to create a faster, racecondition-free version of [FragGeneScan](https://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/FragGeneScan/).
This repository contains my reimplementation in Rust, which is faster than FGS 1.31.
The output is not identical to FGS 1.31, it's closer to 1.30, which I believe is more correct.

The original FGS is licensed under GPL3, so is this repository.
